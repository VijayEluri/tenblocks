TenBlocks
=========

**TenBlocks** is an interactive Java applet that allows the user to solve
simple multiplication problems **x &times; y**, by 
placing "blocks of ten squares" (either **2** &times; **5** or
**3** &times; **3** with and extra **1** square at the corner) until
less than 10 blocks are left in the original block of **x &times; y**.
